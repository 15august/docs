## What is Quest?

A quest on Builder Gym is an **interactive, hands-on challenge** that engages developers and builders in solving practical tasks within the Web3 ecosystem. Itâ€™s a unique way to **learn, compete, and showcase skills** while tackling real-world problems, exploring new tools, and experimenting with cutting-edge technologies like **blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized infrastructure.**

### Why Quests Are Powerful for Companies and DevRels

**1. Engagement and Marketing Tool**
Quests are **powerful engagement instruments** for DevRels and companies. Instead of traditional hackathons or tech events, you can launch a **quest challenge** and achieve similar results with **less effort and fewer resources.** Plus, you gain additional benefits like **data insights and analytics** about developer behavior and expertise.

**2. Part of the Marketing Funnel**
Quests can be integrated into your **marketing strategy** for devs, impacting multiple funnel stages:

* **Awareness:** Introduce your platform or product to new developers.

* **Activation:** Help developers actively interact with your ecosystem.

* **Referral:** Encourage developers to share their achievements and invite others.

**3. Onboarding and Educating Developers**
Quests are perfect for **onboarding** developers. Rather than passively reading documentation, developers actively build, **learn faster**, and retain knowledge more effectively.

**4. Showcasing Use Cases**
Use quests to demonstrate how your technology solves real-world problems. For instance:

* Deploying smart contracts on Ethereum.

* Securing dApps against vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks.

* Creating token and deployng on your chain

**5. Integration with Events**
Quests can be seamlessly integrated into hackathons or conferences, such as ETHIndia or ETHGlobal. They provide structured challenges to help participants:

* Warm up before the hackathon.

* Onboard and learn quickly.

* Dive deeper into your technology stack.

* Engage during hackathon to empower with small wins

### The Viral and Referral Power of Quests

**High-quality quests** can go viral and drive referrals. With **engaging storytelling**, gamified challenges, and a fun user experience, developers are motivated to **share their success** with peers(twitter).

* **Example:** We launched a quest for a bank once and attracted 4,500 developers, with over 1,200+ expressing interest in job opportunities and was taken into the work by HRs.

Builder Gym also includes features to enhance virality:

* Developers can share their quest achievements on social media, where their results inspire others to join.

* Many quests see organic traction in Slack, Telegram groups, and developer communities.

### How Quests Drive Builder Conversion

Quests are a highly effective way to **convert developers into active builders** of your ecosystem:

* **Hands-on activation:** Developers complete tasks like setting up environments, connecting APIs, and deploying smart contracts, completing the most hard phase "to start".

* **Meaningful usage:** Practical examples and real-world tasks show them the value of your product and how to continue using it post-quest.

* **Developer empowerment:** By solving challenges, developers feel confident to innovate and build further after quest.

### Why Quests Matter

Quests arenâ€™t just about solving challenges; theyâ€™re about building connections between **your technology and the developer community.** They demonstrate how your platform solves real problems, how your company cares about its community and prepare better options for their education, success, and prove that youâ€™re committed to their journey.

Builder Gym makes this experience seamless, engaging, and impactfulâ€”bridging the gap between companies and developers, all while fueling the future of Web3. ðŸš€

## Use cases

**1. Technical Quests for Developers:**
Companies can create technical quests where participants, for example, are required to write smart contracts on your blockchain or find vulnerabilities. Our platform automatically deploys a virtual environment for each user, allowing them to interact with real on-chain data. This provides a real-world experience in a controlled "playground" environment. Itâ€™s both fun and educational for developers. They can also be incentivized with tokens or badges, which increases motivation to share the experience and spread the word, helping to grow your reach and awareness. From the company's side, it only takes about an hour to go from idea to a live quest. Post-quest tasks and submission verifications are handled automatically by the platform using predefined scripts.

**2. Warm-Up or Fast Education via Examples**
This can serve as a quick onboarding or educational tool, especially when combined with other events like hackathons. Developers can get up to speed quickly through practical examples and hands-on experience, leading to better results. From the companyâ€™s perspective, this increases activation metrics and improves brand awareness.

**3. Marketing Funnel for Events or Documentation**
We can act as an entry point in the marketing funnel for hackathons, events, or educational documentation. Our platform simplifies Web3 onboarding and app building, with built-in analytics. We focus on viral and referral-based approaches: when one developer is attracted to a quest, theyâ€™re likely to invite 1-2 more friends or colleagues. Additionally, theyâ€™ll share their final score on social media as part of the questâ€™s conclusion, further increasing exposure.

**4. Engagement Tool for Hackathons and Communities**
Our platform can be used as an engagement tool for hackathons or developer communities, motivating developers with small prizes or rewards for achieving intermediate milestones. This fosters more engagement and creates buzz around the event.

**5. Help Developers Find Teammates for Hackathons**
Soon, weâ€™re releasing TRIBES â€” a community-driven feature that allows developers to find teammates for hackathons. Itâ€™s a viral, community-building tool where participants can tell the story of their project and showcase their skills, making it easier for teams to form.

**6. Ongoing Developer Communication**
Our platform allows you to maintain communication with developers and stay up-to-date with participants. Developersâ€™ profiles are connected to their social accounts, such as GitHub, so you can engage with them easily post-event.

**7. Partnership Rewards**
Companies can offer rewards like credits for partner resources, adding an extra incentive for developers to participate and engage with the platform.

**8. Nurturing Your Existing Audience**
For companies that already have an audience, our platform offers a way to nurture and re-engage users. By creating interesting, educational, or entertaining quests, you can share these with your community to keep them engaged and encourage them to participate in new challenges.
