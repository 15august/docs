## **What Are Messages?**

A **message** is the smallest blocks of content within a quest. Messages can contains:

* Instructions(e.g Markdown blocks)

* Questions

* Media (images/videos)

* Validation criteria

* Interactive quizzes&#x20;

* Coding tasks

* etc

You can mix and match message types to create an engaging and dynamic user experience. You can build any storytelling to make more engaging content.

## **Message Types on BuilderGym**

Messages are the foundational elements of quests. Each message type serves a specific purpose, enabling you to design interactive and engaging experiences for users. Below are the key message types and how to configure them:

**1. Dialogue**
Dialogue messages are typically used to simulate communication between the user and a persona, such as **Vitalik**. These messages create a conversational and immersive experience.
**Steps to Create a Dialogue Message:**

1. **Add a Meta User:**

   1. Goto: https://admin.buildergym.xyz/courses/**\[course-id]**/users-meta

   2. Add a new meta user. This meta user will act as the "author" of the dialogue messages (e.g., Vitalik).

2. **Link the Meta User to Your Quest:**

   1. Select the meta user in your quest editor.

3. **Add the Dialogue Message:**

   1. Compose the dialogue text as if it were coming from the meta user.

**2. Deploy Contract**

This message type allows users to deploy a custom Solidity smart contract. It adds interactivity by letting each user deploy a contract tailored to their quest experience.

**Steps to Create a Deploy Contract Message:**

1. **Provide Solidity Code:**

   1. Paste the Solidity code into the provided field.

2. **Configure Contract Deployment:**

   * Add an initial balance (must be less or equal than **0.001 ETH**). Ensure the code is valid
     and contains a **`transfer() `**&#x66;unction.

   * Select the network where the contract will be deployed.

3. **System Behavior:**

   * The platform will compile the Solidity code into bytecode and ABI, then store it in
     the database.

   * Each user gets their own instance of the contract deployed for them.

**3. Task**

The **Task Message** is the core message type, representing an actionable challenge for the user
to complete.

**Steps to Create a Task Message**

1. **Set Completion Rewarding Points:**

   1. Define the number of points a user earns for completing the task.

2. 2\. **Assign a Code Task:**

   1. Link the task to a **Code Task** (explained later).

3. 3\. **Add Additional Checks (Optional):**

   1. If you need custom logic to validate user input, enable **"Need additional checks?"**:

      1. **Additional Check Message ID:** Enter the ID of a related **Deploy**
         **Contract** message. This ID links the task to the deployed contract,
         enabling custom validations.

      2. **Additional Check Code:** Write a TypeScript function to verify the user's
         solution.

**Data Available in Check Code:**

* **jsonData.userMetaMaskAddress:**&#x55;ser'sMetaMaskwalletaddress.

* **jsonData.contract:**&#x41;ddressofthecontractdeployedfortheuser.

* **jsonData.userData:**&#x55;ser'sinputfromthe"Checktheanswer"field. Libraries available for use - Ethers and Axios (soon planning to add web3.js and viem.sh)

**Check Code Functionality:**

1. The code is executed when the user clicks **"Check the answer"**.

2. Use the provided data to validate user actions, such as checking contract interactions or submitted values.

3. The functions should return \{result: boolean, message:string}, message will be shown to the user if the result is false.

**Example Use Case:**

```javascript
(async () => \{
  const balance = await provider.getBalance(jsonData.contract);
  return \{result: balance.toNumber() == 0, message: 'This contract still have some funds on it'}; // true if balance is 0
})();
```

You should add `()` to the function’s end to ensure it is being called. This given example checks the deployed contract’s balance and returns true if it is 0.
