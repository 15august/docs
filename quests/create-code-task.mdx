Code tasks provide users with programming challenges directly in an integrated development environment (IDE). Follow the steps below to create and configure a Code Task.

**Step 1: Navigate to Code Tasks**

1. Go to [https://admin.buildergym.xyz/code-tasks.](https://admin.buildergym.xyz/code-tasks.)

2. You’ll see a list of existing Code Tasks (if any). To create a new one, click the **“Add**
   **Coding Task”** button.

**Step 2: Fill in the Code Task Details**

1. **Name**:

   * Enter a name for the coding task.

   * This name will appear in the **Task Type** dropdown menu when you create a **Task**
     **Message**.

2. **Description**:

   * Write the challenge description in **Markdown** format.

   * This will be displayed to the user when they start the task.
     Example:
     &#x20;    \### Deploy Your First Smart Contract
     &#x20;    Write a Solidity smart contract that implements a simple wallet
     &#x20;    with a \`deposit\` and \`withdraw\` function.

3. **Hint**:

   * Add a hint in **Markdown** format.

   * This will be visible when the user clicks the **“Hint”** button in the IDE.
     Example:
     &#x20;    Check out Solidity’s documentation on \[function
     &#x20;    modifiers]\(https://docs.soliditylang.org) to secure your
     &#x20;    contract.

4. **Language**(Currently inactive):

   1. Choose the programming language. This has no effect on functionality for now, but can be updated later.

**Step 3: Load Content**
There are two key files to upload, both linked to files in a **GitHub repository**:

1. **TaskContent**(Required):

   * Provide a GitHub URL to the starter content.

   * This content will load into the user's workspace the first time they open the task.

   * Example: A skeleton smart contract or starter code.

2. **ShowAnswerContent**(Required):

   * Provide a GitHub URL to the solution file.

   * If the user clicks **“Show Answer”**, this content will replace the task content in
     their IDE.

   * Example: A completed and correct version of the contract or code.
     Also your repo should contain /test folder with unit-tests, it is required, but the tests themselves may be empty. Example test code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "remix\_tests.sol";
contract AttackerTest \{

  function beforeAll() public \{ // nothing to do here}
}

**Step 4: Save the Code Task**
```

1\. Double-check all fields to ensure accuracy.
2\. Click **“Save”** to add the Code Task to the system.

**How to Link a Code Task to a Task Message**

1. When creating a **Task Message**, you’ll see a dropdown for **Task Type**.

2. Select the Code Task you created earlier from the dropdown.

3. Configure other task settings (e.g., completion points, additional checks)
   as needed.
